# Mobile Video Loop

By: [Andrew-Chen-Wang](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang)

iOS Safari Extension (soon Android) that lets you loop
a video on your current website. This only works
for the first video that appears in the website.

I just didn't want to download the YouTube app which
contains ads. Perfect combination for any situation:
AdBlock + PiPifier + Mobile Video Loop.
