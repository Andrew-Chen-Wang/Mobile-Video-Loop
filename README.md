# Mobile Video Loop

By: [Andrew-Chen-Wang](https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang)

iOS Safari Extension (soon Android) that lets you loop
a video on your current website. This only works
for the first video that appears in the website.

I just didn't want to download the YouTube app which
contains ads. Perfect combination for any situation:
AdBlock + PiPifier (once enabled, you can play in 
background since it's in PiP mode) + Mobile Video Loop.

### What This Does

![demo](./media/demo.mp4)

I just want to make 2 things:

1. If there is only one video tag, loop it by adding loop attribute to the video tag
2. If there are multiple, then open a popup that loads the thumbnails of all the videos and have user select which video they want looped.

If you press the button again:

1. Simply disable loop
2. Show which videos to disable loop or enable loop
