Additionally,  with PiPifier, you can watch YouTube videos even when
your phone is shut off. You'll just need to press the play button
on shut off. This can save power.

### Why?

I just didn't want to download the YouTube app which
contains ads. Perfect combination for any situation:
AdBlock + PiPifier (once enabled, you can play in 
background since it's in PiP mode) + Tarda.

Big tech also stifles product innovation, favoring R&D to make more
money rather than product improvements to make their products more fun such
as looping videos from specific time frames. There are also other factors
such as moderation costs of images in comments.

Perfect for background music lovers or meme remixers.
